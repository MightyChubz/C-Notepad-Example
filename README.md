# Notice
This is an extremely old project written when I was 15, I'm not entirely sure what all the code and UI looks like since I failed to comment any of the code (was a bad habit back in the day.) Use this code and edit at your own risk.

# Notepad Example
This was an example of a notepad program in C# that was live streamed on livecoding.tv
